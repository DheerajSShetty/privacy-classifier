"Over the past few days, thousands of Democratic-leaning voters nationwide -- including the young people, minorities and unmarried women who were a crucial part of Barack Obama's 2008 coalition and whom the party is desperate to rouse again on Tuesday -- received a message in their mailboxes that effectively said: we're keeping an eye on you. The mailers are the handiwork of Hal Malchow, a political consultant who is acting on a theory that first intrigued him four years ago. Before the 2006 Michigan gubernatorial primary, three political scientists isolated a group of voters and mailed them copies of their voting histories, listing the elections in which they participated and those they missed. Included were their neighbors' voting histories, too, along with a warning: after the polls closed, everyone would get an updated set. After the primary, the academics examined the voter rolls and were startled by the potency of peer pressure as a motivational tool. The mailer was 10 times better at turning nonvoters into voters than the typical piece of pre-election mail whose effectiveness has ever been measured. Malchow, a 58-year-old former Mississippi securities lawyer who managed Al Gore's first Senate campaign and went on to start a direct-mail firm, read the academics' study and wanted to put the device to work. But he had trouble persuading his firm's clients -- which over the years have included the Democratic National Committee and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- to incorporate such a tactic into their get-out-the-vote programs. All feared a backlash from citizens who might regard the mailer as a threat from someone seeking their vote."

"DAVOS, Switzerland -- When I set out to report at the World Economic Forum, I imagined it might be difficult to find technology-related stories. It turns out, I was a tad wrong.

"In Beverly Hills he is referred to simply as Patrick -- a single name that in certain circles can make your eyelashes curl (in a good way). Patrick Foley, you see, is a personal shopper who is thriving at a time when many in the retail business are struggling to stay afloat. Maybe that's because he's on the ground floor of Barneys in Beverly Hills selling a $30 lipstick, rather than on the fourth floor pushing a $5,000 suit. ''People don't feel guilty splurging on makeup,'' says the 42-year-old personal shopper, whose title is resident makeup artist. Beauty enthusiasts see Foley as a guru, and suppliers are well aware of the influence he wields -- so much so that cosmetics companies scramble to get him new products at least a month before they hit the other stores. But like his clients, he is a tough sell, and since he doesn't work for any label, he can cherry-pick from established lines and any number of indie brands. His office/makeup studio (conveniently located near women's shoes) is a Hollywood hot spot. But instead of sitting in the middle of a department store, clients are ushered into his stark white studio, with Carrara marble countertops, professional lighting and complete privacy. ''Especially in Beverly Hills,'' Foley says, ''you don't want to see people with half their face on!'' SUSAN CAMPOS"
